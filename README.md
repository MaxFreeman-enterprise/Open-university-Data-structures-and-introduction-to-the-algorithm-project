# Open-university-Data-structures-and-introduction-to-the-algorithm-project
The project is a kind of research, in which a comparison will be made between two solutions to the problem of finding and sorting k The smallest numbers out of n given data. Problem definition: Input: n-size array of integers Output k smallest numbers in sorted order The two solutions we will compare are: , BUILD-MIN-HEAP using HEAP-EXTRACT-MIN algorithm k times. vs RANDOMIZED-SELECT algorithm on random array to find and sort the smallest k in the givend array and then resorting them with QUICKSORT algorithm, the rest of the description will be in the readme file.
